# [Ocean artUp](https://ocean-artup.eu)

This repo powers the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site hosted at [ocean-artup.eu](https://ocean-artup.eu). The design and layout make heavy use of [CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid) and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com). It is fully responsive, supports a two-level navbar animated with [`react-spring`](https://www.react-spring.io) (on mobile), [fluid typography](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography), [Algolia search](https://www.algolia.com) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com). This site is maintained by [Janosh Riebesell](https://janosh.io) ([Mail](mailto:janosh.riebesell@gmail.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/janosh)).

Ocean artUp is a research project funded by an [Advanced Grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/205206_en.html) of the European Research Council. It aims to study the feasibility, effectiveness, associated risks and potential side effects of artificial upwelling in increasing ocean productivity, raising fish production, and enhancing oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration.
